Objective Statement

The objective of this project is to design and implement a lightweight IoT-oriented System-on-Chip (SoC) integrating the Microwatt OpenPOWER core with essential low-power peripherals such as UART, SPI, and GPIO. The design emphasizes compact area, reduced power consumption, and efficient communication interfaces to enable deployment in edge and IoT applications.

Proposal Statement

This project proposes the development of a minimal yet functional IoT System-on-Chip (SoC) built around the Microwatt OpenPOWER CPU core. The SoC will integrate standard interfaces, including UART for serial communication, SPI for sensor and peripheral connectivity, and GPIO for direct device control. The architecture will support memory-mapped peripherals, enabling seamless software-hardware interaction. To demonstrate practicality, a reference firmware will be implemented to communicate with external devices through the integrated interfaces. The proposed IoT SoC aims to highlight the adaptability of Microwatt for embedded applications, providing a low-power, open-source alternative to conventional microcontroller-based IoT platforms.
